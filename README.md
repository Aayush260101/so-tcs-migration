üß© Our Use Case: Manual Release Gate in GitHub Actions
We built a GitHub Actions workflow where:

Jobs job1 to job4 run first.

job5 waits for a manual trigger before proceeding.

The goal was to simulate a release gate that could be manually activated after upstream jobs complete.

‚ö†Ô∏è Key Limitation
GitHub Actions does not support pausing a workflow mid-execution and resuming it later from the same point. Once a workflow starts, it must run continuously to completion. This limitation meant we couldn‚Äôt insert a true ‚Äúwait-for-user-trigger‚Äù step inside a running workflow.

üîÑ Our Chosen Alternative: File-Based Trigger
To work around this, we implemented a file-based trigger:

job5 enters a polling loop and checks for the existence of a file (release_trigger.txt) in the repository.

Once the file is detected via GitHub‚Äôs API, the job proceeds.

üõ†Ô∏è What We Did
1Ô∏è‚É£ Triggered the Workflow Manually
We used the workflow_dispatch API to start the workflow:

cmd
curl --ssl-no-revoke -X POST ^
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" ^
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" ^
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/WORKFLOW_FILE_NAME/dispatches ^
  -d "{\"ref\":\"main\"}"
2Ô∏è‚É£ Simulated Failure in job4
We added random failure logic to job4 so we could test retrying failed jobs.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Retried Failed Jobs via API
When job4 failed, we retried it using GitHub‚Äôs rerun-failed-jobs API:

cmd
curl --ssl-no-revoke -X POST ^
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" ^
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" ^
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID/rerun-failed-jobs
4Ô∏è‚É£ Unblocked job5 by Uploading a Trigger File
Once all jobs succeeded, we manually created release_trigger.txt using GitHub‚Äôs content API:

cmd:-
curl --ssl-no-revoke -X PUT ^
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" ^
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" ^
  -d "{\"message\":\"Release Job 5\",\"content\":\"BASE64_ENCODED_CONTENT\"}" ^
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/release_trigger.txt
‚úÖ Final Outcome :-
We successfully triggered the workflow manually.
Simulated failure in job4 and retried it via API.
Used a file-based trigger to manually release job5.
The workflow completed as expected after detecting the trigger file.
